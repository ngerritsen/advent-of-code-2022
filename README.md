# 🎄 Advent of Code 2022

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)
in [Python](https://www.python.org).

## Running the code

1. Make sure [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed on the system.
2. Add the input in a file named `input.txt` next to the solution before running.
3. Run: `python3 src/{day_number}/main.py`

### Faster!

Want assignments to run faster? Install [PyPy](https://pypy.org/). It is an alternative implementation of Python
featuring a JIT, which can run significantly faster.

After installing it just run: `pypy src/{day_number}/main.py`.
